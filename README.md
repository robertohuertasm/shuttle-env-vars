A library to use `.env` files in your [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs) projects.

[Shuttle Secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets) is ok, but sometimes you need to use environment variables so they can be used in other crates.

You could use [Shuttle Secrets](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets) and then iterate over the secrets and set them as environment variables, or you can use this crate.

## Usage

TBD
